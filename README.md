ðŸš€ Excited to Share My Recent Projects! ðŸš€
Internship at Prodigy Infotech:
I developed an interactive navigation menu that remains fixed across pages and changes style on scroll and hover, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project deepened my front-end skills and taught me how to create a dynamic user experience.
Personal Project: Indian Cuisine Restaurant App:
I also created an app showcasing various Indian dishes with a user-friendly interface, applying my skills in web development to combine technology and cuisine.
Thank you to Prodigy Infotech for the amazing opportunity and to everyone who supported me!
